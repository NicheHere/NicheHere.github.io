		<h1 align=center>MEMENTO MORI</h1>
		<div class=column><h2>The Depths</h2>
		<p1> Taking the first steps down into the dark cavens of the crypt you only see the faint flickers of light seeping through the stairway. Stagnant and still air slips into your senses, a dusty and decripid scent is left in its wake. but as ypu take your first few steps you see the torches that line the walls, just barly far enough from eachother to always allow for darkness to creep into view
		<br><br>
		Your steps echoe through the chamber as each one hits the walls of stone and dirt, and as you continue you see it, a fork in the crypt you've walked through. Directly ahead of you is a crack in the stone wall, dirt gathers below the crack with what little light from the torches not reaching more then a few inches in. 
		<br><br>
		To your right, a long deep and stony hallway, reminiscent of he walls you've walked past before, but the difference being the coffins and withering wood lining the walls on shelf like displays.
		<br><br>
		Finally to your left, and collapse of the stone and brick which leads into a deep caverm, ever vast, and ever empty.</p1>
